quickrpc\.promise and \.action_queue module
===========================================

These are tools for async programming.

A :any:`Promise` (also known as a Deferred or a Future) is like an order slip
for something that is still being produced.

An :any:`ActionQueue` is a background worker that manages its own worker thread automatically.
